## About Me 
From a civil engineer, a math teacher, a manager to a data enthusiast! While working as a manager for a Microsoft-Partner company, I found myself dealing daily with tons of records. <br>
<br>Everyday I'd have to go to PowerBI workspaces, scroll scroll scroll, copy data, model it in CSV files and create reports with it, because that's how I saw it being done. <br>
<br>But that didn't feel efficient to me, and that's where I found my passion for data. I was having immense fun trying to find solutions and workarounds, trying to automate and optimize, trying to find insights in metric tons of data and automate insight finding too.<br>
At that point I knew, this is what I want to do now.<br>
<br>Within 4 mere months, and without prior software development experience, I have learned a significant amount of what it means to be a data scientist and analyst, and not only that, I have successfully learned most of the currently used data engineering tech stack. <br>
<br>This was only possible because I genuinely love this field. I come to my desktop with a bowl of noodles and am like, okay, do I watch a movie on netflix while eating? NOPE, data releated videos it is. and I enjoy it too!<br>
